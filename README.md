## How to try it

This application is a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system.
You can interact with commands like:
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

## Requirements

You may want to keep a copy of your database stored in a remote repository.

In order to do so, you can try by configuring the file 'config.properties' in the 'resources' folder.
Please, ask us for the access token so you can complete the 'config.properties' file with the credentials
that we have prepared for you to test the application.

Having set the 'config.properties' file, you will clone our mock database from a repository and the updates 
you make will remain permanent there as well as in your local system.
